# Description

This website for the band provides information of the band, gig information,
clips of the band live<br> and a booking form to book the band. The website is intended
to be accessible on all types of devices<br> mobile phone, tablet, laptop and desktop.

# UX

### Strategy

This project is a website for this band to inform fans of up and comming gigs
and to attract new fans to learn more<br> about the band and its members through
the bands biography section on the main page.
Visitors to the site can also<br> get a feel for the band by visiting the sites 
Live sample page which shows video snippets of live performances.<br>

A person or a business can book the band for private functions or corporate 
events through the sites Contact page.<br>

### Business Goals

* External user goals: <br>
  The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's 
  history and the band members,<br> and possibly book them for shows.

* Site owner's goal: <br>
  The band are interested in selling more of their music and getting more gigs

The site is easy to navigate and is made up of multiple web pages.

# User Stories

* As a Regular Visitor:

  * "I would like to see when and where the band are playing their upcomming gigs."

## Scope
  
   This website incorporate Minimal Viable Product (MVP) elements.

   * Fullfills the needs of both the external user (visitors to the site) and business owner(the band)
     with features such as gig guide, sample clicks, customer/fan review/testimonials and booking form.

   * Website not cluttered with too much information. Band and gig Information is clearly presented. 
     Site is easy to navigate.

## Structure
The website comprises of four webpages. Each page provides the visitor with information of its respective 
page title eg Home, Live, Testimonials and Contact. A navigation bar near the top of each page contains
buttons for each page when pressed will direct the visitor to the relevant page. Although the page titles
are self-explanatory, to enhance UX experience I have included a feature where the actice site page button title name is underlined 
to inform user of what page he is on.

## Skeleton

In the main the wireframes more or less match my final project. Feature such as store page were dropped
as I was told it was outside the scope of the project.

See links to relevent section of the wireframes.

##  Images

The images were choosen to convey a live vibe to entice the visitor 
to check out the band live. The images also blended in well with the 
sites colour scheme.

## Colours

I choose Maroon backcolour for the site title page. For the navigation bar
I choose a black backdrop with Maroon buttons with white colour for site
title on the button. When the vistors moves/hovers the mouse pointer over the maroon button
it changes/transitons to black once mouse moves away its returns to maroon colour
this is to provide a better UX experience for the user.
The colour I feel is in keeping with the bands vibe.

## Typography

I used Google fonts to enhance some text sections of the site. I decided on 
Abril with backup sans-serif for text headings on the home page.

# Technologies Used

* HTML
    * For basic website page structure / markup

* iframe
    * For playing youtube videos

* CSS3
    * CSS3 for styling the website pages aligning elements with padding, margins and I used Float for positioning elements 

* Font Awesome

      its url as a link in the head of site Pages.
    
* Google Font
    * to make Paragraph Heading on Home page look  clearer I used Abril font-family referencing https://fonts.google.com/ CDN<br>

# Testing

Testing was done manually by me and also by members of my family.

* Forms testing:<br>
   I tested the Contact page form on different devices and browsers. 
   This was done by clicking the form submit button on the <br>Contact page
   with the form fields empty to make sure it resulted with the desired response of 'Please fill out this field'.

* Links (Internal & External): <br>
  Each of the links when clicked have been checked so that the user is directed to the desired location. 

The following bug was found early on
Issue:<br>
There was an issue in the Social Media Links  - 1 out of the 4 social media were clickable
this is part of an un-ordered<br> list Item where each social media name showing would be clickable
this bug appeared in initial commit

original code in initial commit was
```html
<li><a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank"></a>Twitter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"></a>Youtube</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank"></a>Instagram</li>
```

Resulted in the Names not being clickable!!

fixed code with:
```html
<li><a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
```
tested and issue was fixed, commited change to github.

Another issue:<br>
I encountered an issue playing youtube video within iframe when 
I included the youtube link as the iframe source it<br> failed to display I
got the message 'www.youtube.com refused to connect'<br>
It turns out iframe only plays youtube videos on embed urls.

Original code with standard youtube url:
```html
iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYPVyJwzerM"
```
fixed by include youtube embeded link instead:
```html
iframe src="iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYPVyJwzerM"
```
There was an issue with Star Rating box on the Testimonial Page being miss-aligned with respect to the other page elements
for Samsung S5 (discovered in Chrome Developer tools) and when Samsung S20 FE phyical phone see screenshot below: 
![Samsung_S20_FE_testimonial_issue_resize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75915440/117506013-d2a89080-af7c-11eb-99e8-cc7cf5e74e1d.jpg)

I Inspected the Star Rating box element in Chrome Developer Tools look in Box model for the element the element positioning is handled by css class star-wrapper-pos
it shows it as a margin issue showing margin-left as 45px when I changed it margin-left to 25px in the box model it fixed it. I created the following media query
in my css file.

@media screen and (min-width: 360px){

    .star-wrapper-pos{
        margin-left: 25px; 
    }
}

 This fixed the issue for Samsung mobile see screenshot below, however it impacted the iphone 6/7/8 where the Star Rating box was mis-aligned on these devices. This was fixed by adding a star-wrapper-pos rule in its media query as follows:
 
   .star-wrapper-pos{
        margin-left: 53px; 
   }
